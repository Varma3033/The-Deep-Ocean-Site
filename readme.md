# Developer Notes

https://varma3033.github.io/The-Deep-Ocean-Site/

My website looks into 'The Deep Ocean' and the different zones of it.
The site has been structured so that as you go deeper, the section colour becomes darker, imitating the different zones of the ocean

It is an interactive yet informative site which uses flippable cards on each section/zone of the ocean, that display images and fun facts of animals found in each layer.

Some other features I have included are:
-sidebar navigation with can be accessed on the hompage to take users directly to sections
-a self typing text animation/loop on the home screen to add dramatic effect for the depth of the ocean
-down buttons leading to each different section
-clickable navigation dots that can take users directly to sections and that display what section they are on

I think some strengths in my website are its simplicity and clear structure. The site is pretty easy to follow and use, and does its job at being informative. Also I have tried not to use any JS library and created everything myself. I have implemented features like flexbox and media queries to improve responsivity, however this is not fully complete, due to time restrictions.

There are definitely several areas I could improve on in terms of my code. I think there are probably a few elements and interactions which I could have created and grouped in Javascript, but I wanted to actually understand and know what I was writing instead of just copying tutorials, hence most of the code I feel is simple and what I actually understand.

Also I think I have tended to repreat a lot of code in CSS with things like padding, width and height, which I could get rid of to simplify my code further.
In terms of design, I know some of the padding in sections feels off and the homepage looks bland, so I definitely could improve on these with more time.

This assignment was quite useful for me, learning how I could better use HTML and CSS with Javascript. Learning about modifying the DOM and using jS functions, loops, events and variables was also quite interesting and has improved my logic and debugging skills.

Overall, this was a interesting project which has no only deepened my knowledge of web design and JS but also the deep ocean.
